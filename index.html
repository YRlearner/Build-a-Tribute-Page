                <p>Ibn Baṭṭūṭah was a medieval Muslim traveler who wrote one of the world’s most famous travel logs, the Riḥlah. This great work describes the people, places, and cultures he encountered in his journeys along some 75,000 miles (120,000 km) across and beyond the Islamic world.
                </p>
                <p>While Ibn Baṭṭūṭah did not explore new lands or contribute much to our knowledge of geography, his Riḥlah has tremendous documentary value because of its detailed accounts of social, cultural, and political aspects of much of the Islamic world at the time. His unique and mostly reliable historiography remains valuable for the study of history.</p>
                <p> Ibn Baṭṭūṭah was born into a family of qadis, Muslim judges who enjoyed significant civil authority at the time. He was educated toward this end in his hometown of Tangier. His travels began when he undertook a pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca.</p>
                <p> Ibn Baṭṭūṭah was trained as a qadi, a Muslim judge who ruled on matters both religious and civil. He worked as a qadi in various places, including Delhi, the Maldives, and possibly Morocco toward the end of his life. His travels were independent of his occupation, however, and depended on the support of benefactors.<p>
